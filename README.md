```$xslt
npm install
```
If you don't have npm go to this site to get setup https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

2.) Start your http-server with the following command:

```$xslt
npm start
```
If you want to edit this script go to the `package.json` file.
You can edit the port here.

3). Go to  http://localhost:8989

Navigate through the folders
`src->demos->00_template`

4.) You should see your React app running!

## Setting up Gulp (optional)

You can also use Gulp to add additional build tasks. To use, follow the instructions below.

Navigate to the root directory and  run the following command:
```

```

After modules are installed, you can start watching for SCSS changes using the command:

You can install more modules and configure them in the **gulpfile.js** file as needed.
